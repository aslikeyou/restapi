Rest api example
======

To start, you need to isert `example.sql` into your database.

After you need to write your database params in the file `protected/config/main.php`

Then start web server with `sh server.sh`

Go to `client` directory and play with `getlist.php` and `getuser.php`.

Web-server is available on `http://localhost:8000/`

Default route `main` will show you all available routes

**Tested on PHP 5.5.18, Mysql 5.6.21, OS X 10.10.1**

Have fun:))
